### Exploring Bikeshare


### Description
This project is completed during the Udacity Data Science non-degree program (2020).
The main purpose of the project is to a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. Some of the questions answered during this exploration include:
1. What is the most popular month for start time?
2. What is the most popular day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) for start time?
3. What is the most popular hour of the day to start time?
4. What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?
5. What is the most popular start station and most popular end station?
6. What is the most popular trip?
7. What are the counts of each user type?
8. What are the counts of gender?
9. What are the earliest (i.e. oldest person), most recent (i.e. youngest person), and most popular birth years?

### Data Sources
